Adafruit Neopixels using the Arduino Yun

Supports Chelmsford Makerspace's BETT project for the Heppell Stand.

The idea is to light up two strips of Adafruit LED pixels with a percentage depending on a value sent from a webpage on an Internet device.

Uses 2 x Adafruit 50 pixel strips and one Arduino Yun.  Most of the code would probably work on any other Arduino, we just want network connectivity.
