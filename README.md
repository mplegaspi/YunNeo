YunNeo 

Adafruit Neopixels using the Arduino Yun



Strip A - shows the averaged score of the Objective values x 10 as Red LEDS
Strip B - shows the averaged score of the Subjective values as Blue LEDS

Both strips flash LEDS that represent grade values so if you have an E none flash and if you have A they all flash (if that's not annoying!!)
